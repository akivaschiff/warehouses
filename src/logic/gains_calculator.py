    Calculate simple inflow/outflow gains for a warehouse.
    
    Pure logic function - takes an iterator of exchange objects, returns GainReport.

    Chapter 0 scope:
    - Only interchangeable commodities (wheat, steel, oil, etc.)
    - Simple calculation: total_outflow_value - total_inflow_cost = gain/loss
    - Breakdown by commodity type (wheat vs steel vs oil)
    - Analyzes entire time period (no date filtering)

        warehouse_id: The warehouse ID being analyzed
        exchanges: Iterator of exchange dictionaries (both inflows and outflows)
