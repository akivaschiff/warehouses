# Task 0: Hello Warehouse

Did you know that warehouses shape our lives? Every product you touch—from your morning coffee to your smartphone—has passed through multiple warehouses on its journey to you. These massive buildings quietly orchestrate trillions of dollars worth of goods flowing across the globe, yet despite moving more value than most stock exchanges, these critical transactions remain largely invisible. Until now...

In the upcoming project, I will be your Warehouse Master, and I will guide you on your quest to find the buried treasure hidden in millions of trading records and claim the ultimate prize — accurate profit calculations.

Let's begin my making sure our setup is good and the flow runs:


```bash
# Test flow and connection
make run-flow
```
Don't worry if you see alot of "0"-s. We'll fix that right away. The password to your first quest is "Ph@s3V"
