# Task 5: The Grand Warehouse Consolidation

Legendary work, Master of FIFO! You've unlocked the secrets of true merchant accounting, but your greatest challenge awaits...

Your perfect FIFO calculations only show one piece of a vast trading entity. But there is one last problem:

Warehouse A buys wheat for $10,000
Warehouse A "sells" to Warehouse B for $12,000
Your system celebrates: "$2,000 profit!" ðŸŽ‰

WRONG! This is just moving money between your own pockets! True profit only comes from trading with external entities.


Companies need to see their true warehouse-wide performance - all warehouses combined, Only external trades count toward real gains. Internal moves are just... bookkeeping theater.

## Objective

Aggregates FIFO gains across ALL warehouses owned by a company.
Excludes internal transfers between same-entity warehouses.
Shows external trades only for true profit calculation.

Now for the final test you must look at the `warehouses` table to see which warehouses belong to the same company and 
reveals which warehouses are the most profitable!

Good luck!
