# Task 3: Add Serialized Items Support

## Objective
Expand the system to handle both bulk commodities and serialized items with updated reporting structure.

## Background
Currently, the system only processes `commodity_standard = 'bulk'`. We need to add support for `commodity_standard = 'serialized'` items (like art, cars, equipment) and restructure the GainReport to show separate summaries.

## Instructions

### 1. Update Exchange Model
Modify `src/models/exchange.py`:

**Add new enum value:**
```python
class CommodityStandard(str, Enum):
    BULK = "bulk"           # Existing: wheat, oil, steel
    SERIALIZED = "serialized"  # New: art, cars, equipment
```

**Add token_id field:**
```python
class Exchange(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    token_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Unique token ID for serialized items")
```

**Update helper methods:**
```python
def is_serialized(self) -> bool:
    """Check if this is a serialized item (art, cars, etc.)"""
    return self.commodity_standard == CommodityStandard.SERIALIZED
```

### 2. Update GainReport Structure
Modify `src/models/gain_report.py`:

**Add commodity standard breakdowns:**
```python
@dataclass
class GainReport:
    warehouse_id: str
    reporter_name: str
    analysis_date: datetime
    
    # Overall totals
    total_inflow_cost: Decimal
    total_outflow_value: Decimal
    total_gain_loss: Decimal
    total_transactions: int
    
    # NEW: Breakdown by commodity standard
    bulk_inflow_cost: Decimal
    bulk_outflow_value: Decimal
    bulk_gain_loss: Decimal
    bulk_transactions: int
    
    serialized_inflow_cost: Decimal
    serialized_outflow_value: Decimal
    serialized_gain_loss: Decimal
    serialized_transactions: int
    
    # Detailed breakdowns
    gains_by_commodity: List[CommodityGains]  # All commodities
    gains_by_bulk_commodity: List[CommodityGains]  # Bulk only
    gains_by_serialized_commodity: List[CommodityGains]  # Serialized only
    
    # Date range
    analysis_start_date: Optional[datetime] = None
    analysis_end_date: Optional[datetime] = None
```

### 3. Update Gains Calculator Logic
Modify `src/logic/gains_calculator.py`:

**Process both commodity standards:**
```python
def calculate_warehouse_gains(...) -> GainReport:
    # Initialize tracking for both standards
    bulk_inflow_cost = Decimal('0')
    bulk_outflow_value = Decimal('0')
    bulk_transactions = 0
    
    serialized_inflow_cost = Decimal('0')
    serialized_outflow_value = Decimal('0')
    serialized_transactions = 0
    
    # Process ALL exchanges (not just bulk)
    for exchange in exchanges:
        if not exchange.is_relevant_for(warehouse_id):
            continue
            
        # Track by commodity standard
        if exchange.is_bulk():
            if exchange.is_inflow_for(warehouse_id):
                bulk_inflow_cost += exchange.price_paid_usd
                bulk_transactions += 1
            elif exchange.is_outflow_for(warehouse_id):
                bulk_outflow_value += exchange.price_paid_usd
                bulk_transactions += 1
                
        elif exchange.is_serialized():
            if exchange.is_inflow_for(warehouse_id):
                serialized_inflow_cost += exchange.price_paid_usd
                serialized_transactions += 1
            elif exchange.is_outflow_for(warehouse_id):
                serialized_outflow_value += exchange.price_paid_usd
                serialized_transactions += 1
    
    # Calculate gains by standard
    bulk_gain_loss = bulk_outflow_value - bulk_inflow_cost
    serialized_gain_loss = serialized_outflow_value - serialized_inflow_cost
    
    # ... build separate commodity lists ...
```

### 4. Update Database Query
Modify `src/flows/warehouse_gains_flow.py`:

**Remove bulk-only filter:**
```python
def fetch_warehouse_exchanges(warehouse_id: str, client: SupabaseClient):
    # Fetch BOTH bulk AND serialized exchanges
    inflows = client.find('exchanges', {
        'to_warehouse': warehouse_id
        # Remove: 'commodity_standard': 'bulk'
    })
    
    outflows = client.find('exchanges', {
        'from_warehouse': warehouse_id
        # Remove: 'commodity_standard': 'bulk'
    })
```

### 5. Test with Mixed Data
Create test data with both standards:

```python
# Test with warehouse that has both bulk and serialized items
report = analyze_warehouse_gains("WH_mixed_inventory")

print(f"Total Gain: ${report.total_gain_loss:,.2f}")
print(f"Bulk Gain: ${report.bulk_gain_loss:,.2f}")
print(f"Serialized Gain: ${report.serialized_gain_loss:,.2f}")
print(f"Bulk Commodities: {len(report.gains_by_bulk_commodity)}")
print(f"Serialized Items: {len(report.gains_by_serialized_commodity)}")
```

## Expected Output Format
```
üìä Analysis Results for WH_12345
üí∞ Total Summary:
   Total Gain/Loss:        $125,000.00
   Total Transactions:     45

üèóÔ∏è Bulk Commodities:
   Bulk Gain/Loss:         $75,000.00
   Bulk Transactions:      40
   Top Commodities:
   ‚Ä¢ Wheat: $45,000.00 (25 trades)
   ‚Ä¢ Steel: $30,000.00 (15 trades)

üé® Serialized Items:
   Serialized Gain/Loss:   $50,000.00
   Serialized Transactions: 5
   Top Items:
   ‚Ä¢ Art Pieces: $35,000.00 (3 trades)
   ‚Ä¢ Luxury Cars: $15,000.00 (2 trades)
```

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ Exchange model accepts serialized commodity standard  
‚úÖ GainReport shows separate bulk vs. serialized summaries  
‚úÖ Calculator processes both commodity types  
‚úÖ Database queries include all commodity standards  
‚úÖ Results display clear breakdown between types  

## Next Steps
With support for both commodity types, you're ready to implement proper FIFO capital gains calculation in Task 4.
