# Task 3: Support Serialized Items

Excellent work, trader! The pricing is now precise, but our warehouse holds secrets beyond mere bulk commodities...

Your warehouse isn't just storing wheat and steel - it houses unique items! Art pieces, luxury cars, rare equipment - each with its own token_id. These serialized artifacts trade differently than bulk goods, and your report must honor both realms.
Currently your system only recognizes `commodity_standard = 'bulk'` exchanges. But the database contains `serialized` items waiting to be discovered!

## Objective
Expand your calculate_warehouse_gains() to process both types and split the GainReport accordingly. edit the enum `CommodityStandard` and here's the new GainReport:

```
class GainReport:
    warehouse_id: str
    reporter_name: str
    analysis_date: datetime
    
    # Overall totals (same as before)
    total_inflow_cost: Decimal
    total_outflow_value: Decimal
    total_gain_loss: Decimal
    
    # ðŸ†• NEW: Breakdown by commodity standard
    bulk_inflow_cost: Decimal
    bulk_outflow_value: Decimal
    bulk_gain_loss: Decimal
    
    serialized_inflow_cost: Decimal
    serialized_outflow_value: Decimal
    serialized_gain_loss: Decimal
    
    # Enhanced commodity breakdowns
    gains_by_commodity: List[CommodityGains]  # All commodities combined
```

As usual - when you're ready, just re-run our flow on warehouse `"WH_30f6fae4"` using:

```bash
make run-flow
```
and the number to continue is the new `Total Gain/Loss`.
