# Task 1: The warehouse gain report

Every warehouse should be able to produce a report summarizing the total value that went through it. An "inflow" is the cost we pay to bring commodities into the warehouse and the "outflow" is the money we make from selling it out. The "gain" is the difference between these two numbers and is hopefully a positive one (but don't worry if it isn't - warehouses have more magic up their sleeves).

## Objective
Implement the logic in the function calculate_warehouse_gains. The return type will help you understand what calculations to do. When you're ready, just run our flow on warehouse `"WH_30f6fae4"` using:

```bash
# Test flow and connection
make run-flow
```

The exact numeric value of `Total Gain/Loss` after you successfully implement it will help you unlock your next quest!
