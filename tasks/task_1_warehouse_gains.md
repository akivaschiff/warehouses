# Task 1: The warehouse gain report
Great! You've conquered the connection-quest and seen those mysterious zeros. Now it's time to turn those zeros into gold...

Every warehouse should be able to produce a report summarizing the total value that flowed through it. An "inflow" represents the cost we pay to bring commodities into the warehouse, while an "outflow" represents the money we earn from selling commodities out of the warehouse. The "gain" is the difference between these two numbers and is hopefully positive (but don't worry if it isn't - warehouses have more magic up their sleeves).

## Objective
Implement the logic in the function `calculate_warehouse_gains`. The return type will help you understand what calculations to do. When you're ready, just run our flow on warehouse `"WH_30f6fae4"` using:


```bash
# Test flow and connection
make run-flow
```

When successful, you should see a report with many numbers!
The exact numeric value of `Total Gain/Loss` after you successfully implement it will help you unlock your next quest!
