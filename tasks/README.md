# Workshop Tasks - Warehouse Exchange System

This folder contains the progressive workshop tasks that build from basic warehouse analysis to sophisticated multi-entity portfolio management.

## Task Progression

### üìä [Task 1: Verify Warehouse Gains Calculation](task_1_verify_warehouse_gains.md)
**Foundation**: Test your basic gains calculator
- Run analysis on warehouse `WH_c979f0a5`
- Verify total gain of $1,673,000
- Ensure end-to-end flow works

### üí∞ [Task 2: Implement Precise Daily Pricing](task_2_implement_precise_pricing.md)  
**Enhancement**: Replace monthly averages with daily price data
- Join with price tables (`prices_wheat`, `prices_steel`, etc.)
- Calculate precise daily pricing
- Compare results with original monthly pricing

### üé® [Task 3: Add Serialized Items Support](task_3_add_serialized_items.md)
**Expansion**: Support both bulk and serialized commodities
- Extend Exchange model for serialized items
- Update GainReport for commodity standard breakdown
- Process art, cars, equipment alongside bulk commodities

### üìà [Task 4: Implement FIFO Capital Gains Algorithm](task_4_implement_fifo_algorithm.md)
**Sophistication**: Replace simple math with proper cost basis tracking
- Understand FIFO (First-In-First-Out) methodology
- Track cost basis for inventory purchases
- Calculate accurate capital gains using proper accounting

### üè¢ [Task 5: Entity-Level Portfolio Analysis](task_5_entity_level_analysis.md)
**Integration**: Multi-warehouse portfolio management
- Aggregate gains across company warehouses
- Exclude internal transfers from gains calculation
- Provide consolidated entity-level reporting

## Learning Progression

| Task | Focus Area | Complexity | Key Skills |
|------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Testing & Validation | ‚≠ê | Debugging, verification |
| 2 | Data Integration | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | SQL joins, data processing |
| 3 | Data Modeling | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Type systems, architecture |
| 4 | Financial Algorithms | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | FIFO logic, accounting |
| 5 | Business Logic | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Entity relationships, portfolio |

## Prerequisites
- Completed Chapter 0 basic implementation
- Database populated with exchange data
- Understanding of warehouse exchange concepts

## Expected Timeline
- **Task 1**: 30 minutes (verification)
- **Task 2**: 2-3 hours (data integration)  
- **Task 3**: 2-4 hours (model expansion)
- **Task 4**: 4-6 hours (FIFO algorithm)
- **Task 5**: 4-8 hours (entity analysis)

## Workshop Flow
Each task builds on the previous one:
1. **Verify** your foundation works
2. **Enhance** with accurate pricing  
3. **Expand** to handle more data types
4. **Sophisticate** with proper financial calculations
5. **Integrate** into enterprise-level analysis

## Success Metrics
By the end of Task 5, you'll have built:
- ‚úÖ Production-ready gains calculation system
- ‚úÖ Support for multiple commodity types
- ‚úÖ Accurate FIFO-based capital gains
- ‚úÖ Enterprise portfolio management
- ‚úÖ Complex business logic handling

Each task includes detailed instructions, code examples, test scenarios, and success criteria to guide your implementation.
