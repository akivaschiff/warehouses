# Warehouse Exchange System

Your quest awaits you! Please proceed to `tasks/task_0_hello_warehouse.md`


Improvements for next time:
- The tasks finished too quickly because people just asked te bot to do them. No method of verification.
- Each task must have the asnwer in the end (I need to check the data)
- The fifo data isn't amazing because it's not generated to be FIFO meaning that there are many sells without buys
- “The definition of done of the Rules was not good” - "try to add a Rule" is not enough. There should be a more specific action to do after the rules. maybe having a test and changing a test.
- How can i force people to focus on the code? the quality and style? IF you care about it then it's important otherwise you just tell the bot to finish quick.
- (I should update the cursor AI interface to be up to date)
- I can have a resouces handout at the end
- Maybe let someone show their solution to a level and go over the code together.
